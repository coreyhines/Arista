A Python script for updating the AlertBase.json file on CVX running EOS.
Script can be run manually, or using a scheduler to automatically check www.arista.com
for database updates for the CVX Bugalerts feature.

To learn more about BugAlerts see: https://eos.arista.com/eos-4-17-0f/bug-alerts/

INSTALLATION
1. ssh to the primary CVX node in the CVX cluster
2. wget https://github.com/coreyhines/Arista/raw/master/bugalertUpdate.py
